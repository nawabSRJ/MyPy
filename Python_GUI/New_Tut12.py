# To add some space around each frame, you can set the padding of each cell in the grid. Padding is just some blank space that surrounds a widget and visually sets its content apart.

# The two types of padding are external and internal padding. External padding adds some space around the outside of a grid cell. Itâ€™s controlled with two keyword arguments to .grid():

# padx adds padding in the horizontal direction.
# pady adds padding in the vertical direction.

window = tk.Tk()

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):

        label = tk.Label(master=frame, text=f"Row {i}\nColumn {j}")
        # label.pack()
        # * The extra padding around the Label widgets gives each cell in the grid a little bit of breathing room between the Frame border and the text in the label:

        label.pack(padx = 5, pady= 5)

        
window.mainloop()

# * here the rows and columns will not expand as we resize the window. we will learn this in next Tutorial
